goutham-m77: I want you to create me an deep agent, which is able to communicate and fetch results from the database with the input of a user query. It must be able to choose smartly over what schema or what table to pick from. Must have memory to help 

Deep agent means : implementing a combination of four things: a planning tool, sub agents, access to a file system, and a detailed prompt. deepagents library can be used as well if needed.

This must also be able to fetch discrepancies in data, for that I will specify the business logic later. Just keep it ready

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a deep agent for database interaction that can intelligently query databases based on user input and identify data discrepancies. Let's begin by creating a structured project for this SQL agent.

First, let's check what's in your workspace to see if there's any existing code we can leverage. Let's create a new workspace for our SQL agent with all necessary components: Let's set up a Python project for our SQL agent: Let's create the basic project structure manually for our SQL agent. First, let's create the necessary directories: Now, let's create the Copilot instructions file: 

Made changes.

Let's create our README.md file: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the requirements.txt file with necessary dependencies: 

Made changes.

Let's create a tasks.json file to make it easy to run the project: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create a .env file for configuration: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the core agent modules. First, let's create the main agent file: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the memory module: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the planner module: 

Made changes.

Let's create a custom implementation for the planner since the deepagents library import is showing errors: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's update the Planner class to remove the dependency on deepagents: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's create a db_utils file to handle database connection and utilities: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create an initialization file for the utils package: 

Made changes.

Let's create the sub-agents directory and the three sub-agents: First, let's create the schema agent: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the query agent: 

Made changes.

Now, let's create the discrepancy agent: 

Made changes.

Let's create the __init__.py files for our packages: 

Made changes.

Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

goutham-m77: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

Let's create a simple example script to demonstrate how to use the SQL Agent: 

Made changes.

Let's create a simple test file: 

Made changes.

Let's create an __init__.py file for the tests directory: 

Made changes.

Finally, let's create a setup.py file: 

Made changes.

Now our SQL Agent project is complete! Here's a summary of what we've built:

1. **Core Agent Architecture**:
   - Main `SQLAgent` class with planning, execution, and discrepancy detection
   - Memory module for context retention across sessions
   - Planning module to break down complex queries into steps

2. **Sub-Agents**:
   - `SchemaAgent`: Intelligently selects the appropriate schema and tables
   - `QueryAgent`: Generates and executes SQL from natural language queries
   - `DiscrepancyAgent`: Identifies data inconsistencies based on business rules

3. **Key Features**:
   - Natural language processing to generate SQL queries
   - Memory system to maintain context across sessions
   - Planning capabilities to handle complex queries
   - Business rule engine for discrepancy detection
   - Integration with OpenAI for advanced SQL generation

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Well-organized Python package with modular design
   - Test suite with unit tests
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Example script to demonstrate usage

To use the SQL Agent, you'll need to:

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file with your database connection details.

3. Run the example script:
   ```
   python -m sql_agent.run
   ```

4. You can customize the business rules in the `set_sample_business_rules` function in `run.py` to implement your specific business logic for discrepancy detection.

The agent is designed to be extensible, so you can easily add more features or modify existing ones to meet your specific requirements. The memory system allows the agent to learn from past interactions, and the planning module enables it to handle complex multi-step queries.

goutham-m77: One thing, I am using oracledb. Please change stuff to that

Another thing is, I am using Amazon bedrock. So configure that as well. And choose a model which will be best for our use case. Thank you.

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the SQL Agent to use Oracle DB instead of the generic SQLAlchemy approach and integrate Amazon Bedrock for AI capabilities. Let's make these changes:

1. First, let's update the requirements.txt to include the necessary libraries: 
```


Made changes.


```
2. Now, let's update the db_utils.py file to work with Oracle DB: 
```


Made changes.


```
3. Let's continue updating the db_utils.py file with the remaining function: 
```


Made changes.


```
4. Let's update the utils/__init__.py file: 
```


Made changes.


```
5. Now, let's create a new file to handle Amazon Bedrock integration: 

Made changes.

6. Let's update the SQL Agent main class to use Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock: 
```


Made changes.


```
7. Now, let's update the SQLAgent class initialization and methods to use Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock: 
```


Made changes.


```
8. Let's update the get_schema_info method in the SQLAgent class: 
```


Made changes.


```
9. Let's update the schema_agent.py file to work with Oracle DB: 
```


Made changes.


```
10. Let's update the query_agent.py file to use Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock: 
```


Made changes.


```
11. Let's update the discrepancy_agent.py file to use Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock: 
```


Made changes.


```
12. Let's update the run.py file to use the new Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock integration: 
```


Made changes.


```
13. Let's update the .env.example file to include Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock configuration: 
```


Made changes.


```
14. Finally, let's add an __init__.py file to expose the main classes: Let's check if the file already exists and then update it: 
```


Made changes.


```
The SQL Agent has been successfully updated to work with Oracle DB and Amazon Bedrock! Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Oracle DB Integration**:
   - Updated to use the `oracledb` library instead of SQLAlchemy
   - Created Oracle-specific connection and query methods
   - Adapted schema and table discovery to work with Oracle's system tables
   - Updated SQL queries to use Oracle syntax (e.g., ROWNUM instead of LIMIT)

2. **Amazon Bedrock Integration**:
   - Added a new `BedrockAgent` class for AI capabilities
   - Configured to use Claude 3 Sonnet by default (excellent balance of performance and cost for SQL tasks)
   - Integrated with both the query agent (for SQL generation) and discrepancy agent (for analysis)
   - Implemented proper fallback mechanisms if Bedrock is unavailable

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated environment variables for Oracle DB connection
   - Added AWS/Bedrock configuration options
   - Simplified the setup process with sensible defaults

4. **Improved Discrepancy Detection**:
   - Enhanced the discrepancy detection with AI capabilities from Bedrock
   - Updated business rules to use Oracle SQL syntax
   - Added more robust error handling

To use the updated SQL Agent:

1. Copy the .env.example file to `.env` and fill in your Oracle DB connection details and AWS credentials
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the example script:
   ```
   python -m sql_agent.run
   ```

The agent will now connect to your Oracle database and use Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3 Sonnet model for advanced AI capabilities. You can ask natural language questions, and the agent will generate optimized Oracle SQL, execute the queries, and detect any discrepancies based on the business rules you define.

goutham-m77: I use aws session token ,  AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

oracle user, password and dsn . thats it 

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the configuration files to use AWS session token and simplify the Oracle connection to just use username, password, and DSN. Let's make these changes: 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the db_utils.py file to use these simplified Oracle connection parameters: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now, let's update the create_oracle_connection function to use the simplified connection parameters: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now, let's update the BedrockAgent class to use AWS session token: 
```


Made changes.


```
Summarized conversation historyLet's also make sure we add the import for `os` in the bedrock_agent.py file if it's not already there: Great! The `os` module is already imported. Now, let's check the bedrock_agent.py file constructor to make sure we're not missing any parameters there: Now let's check if we need to update the AWS profile logic in the constructor: The constructor is already properly handling AWS credentials. The AWS session token is pulled from the environment directly in the `_initialize_client` method, which is the correct approach since it's a time-limited credential that would typically be set in the environment.

Let's examine the main run.py file to see if we need to update any examples or documentation there: Let's see the rest of this file: No update is needed for the run.py file since it's already configured to use environment variables. 

Let's look at the test_bedrock_agent.py file to ensure any tests are updated to work with the session token: Let's check for any tests that might be related: Let's check more of the test file: Let's check the final part of the test file: There are no Bedrock-specific tests that need to be updated. The existing tests are mocked appropriately.

Let's create a README.md file if one doesn't exist to document the project and the updated connection parameters: Let's see the rest of the README: Let's update the README.md to reflect the Oracle and AWS Bedrock configuration: 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Let's also update the example at the top of the README to correctly reflect the Oracle and AWS Bedrock integration: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's add a section on running the example: 
```


Made changes.


```
Perfect! I've made all the necessary updates to support AWS session token in the Bedrock agent and improved the documentation:

1. Updated the bedrock_agent.py file to:
   - Check for and use the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variable when initializing the Bedrock client
   - Apply the session token to both the bedrock-runtime and bedrock clients
   - Maintain backward compatibility with profile-based authentication

2. Updated the README.md file to:
   - Accurately describe the project as an Oracle DB and AWS Bedrock-based SQL agent
   - Document the simplified Oracle connection parameters (username, password, DSN)
   - Include AWS_SESSION_TOKEN in the configuration examples
   - Provide more detailed usage examples with business logic setup
   - Add information about running the example script
   - Update the project structure section to reflect all components

These changes ensure that the SQL agent can now authenticate to AWS Bedrock using session tokens, which is common when using temporary credentials in environments like AWS IAM roles or when using tools like AWS SSO.

The Oracle DB connection has been simplified to use just username, password, and DSN as requested, and all documentation has been updated accordingly.

goutham-m77: i dont want aws profile name

GitHub Copilot: I'll remove the AWS_PROFILE entry from your .env file. 
```


Made changes.


```
I've removed the `AWS_PROFILE` entry from your .env file as requested. The AWS credentials (access key, secret key, and session token) will now be used directly without any profile configuration.

goutham-m77: what about this

GitHub Copilot: I see you're pointing to the line in bedrock_agent.py where the profile name is still being loaded from environment variables. Since you don't want to use AWS profile name, let's update this line: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's also update the corresponding part of the `_initialize_client` method to remove the profile-based initialization path since we'll no longer be using profiles: 
```


Made changes.


```
Also, let's update the test connection part to use the same credential approach: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's also update the `__init__` method to remove the profile_name parameter since we won't be using it anymore: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's also update the docstring to remove the profile_name parameter: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to check if there are any references to the `profile_name` parameter when creating a `BedrockAgent` instance in other files: Let me check the agent.py file to see how BedrockAgent is being instantiated: Great! The BedrockAgent initialization in agent.py doesn't pass a profile_name parameter, so we don't need to update that.

Let's also look at the run.py file to make sure there are no changes needed there: The run.py file also doesn't pass a profile_name parameter, so we're good there.

Finally, let's check if there are any mentions of AWS_PROFILE in the README.md and update if necessary: Let's update the README.md: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's also update the .env.example file: 
```


Made changes.


```
Great! I've made all the necessary changes to remove AWS profile usage from your SQL agent:

1. Updated bedrock_agent.py:
   - Removed the profile_name parameter from the constructor
   - Set `self.profile_name = None` to ensure profiles aren't used
   - Updated the `_initialize_client` method to use direct AWS credentials
   - Added explicit access key and secret key parameters to boto3 client creation
   - Updated the docstrings to remove profile_name references

2. Updated the configuration files:
   - Removed AWS_PROFILE from your .env file
   - Updated the README.md to use direct credentials instead of profiles
   - Updated the .env.example file to remove the AWS_PROFILE option

The SQL agent will now use direct AWS credentials (access key, secret key, and session token) instead of profile-based authentication, as requested.

goutham-m77:   Value error, Claude v3 models are not supported by this LLM.Please use `from langchain_aws import ChatBedrock` instead. [type=value_error, input_value={'model_id': 'anthropic.c....2, 'max_tokens': 4096}}, input_type=dict]

GitHub Copilot: This error indicates we need to update the BedrockAgent class to use `ChatBedrock` instead of `BedrockLLM` since Claude v3 models aren't supported by the `BedrockLLM` class. Let me fix that: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's update all instances of `BedrockLLM` to `ChatBedrock`: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's update the `generate_sql` and `analyze_discrepancies` methods to work with the new `ChatBedrock` class, as the interface might be slightly different: 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Let's update the way we pass the prompts to `ChatBedrock` as it might expect a different format than `BedrockLLM`: The format of the prompt is fine. Now let's check the documentation for `ChatBedrock` and add any necessary imports for its use: Let's check if we need to install the langchain-aws package: Let's use the appropriate tool: Now we need to add an additional import for the `ChatMessage` class to construct messages properly for the Claude models: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's update how we pass the prompts to use the ChatMessage format: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's do the same for the discrepancy analysis method: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's update the requirements.txt file to include the langchain-aws package with the appropriate version: Let's update the version of langchain-aws in the requirements file: 
```


Made changes.


```
Great! I've updated the BedrockAgent class to use `ChatBedrock` instead of `BedrockLLM` to properly support Claude v3 models. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Changed the import from `from langchain_aws import BedrockLLM` to `from langchain_aws import ChatBedrock`
2. Added import for `from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage` to format messages properly
3. Updated the initialization of the LLM:
   - Changed `BedrockLLM` to `ChatBedrock`
   - Changed `max_tokens` parameter to `max_tokens_to_sample` for compatibility with Claude v3
4. Updated the invoke calls:
   - Now using `self.llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=prompt)])` instead of `self.llm.invoke(prompt)`
   - Accessing response content with `response.content`
5. Updated the requirements.txt file to use a newer version of langchain-aws (>=0.1.0)

These changes will resolve the ValueError you were seeing, as the ChatBedrock class is designed to work with Claude v3 models, while BedrockLLM was not.
