goutham-m77: So in this project, we run into our first problem. The database schema is tooo huge. How do we solve that

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you solve the problem of handling a large database schema in your SQL Agent project. Let's explore the codebase to understand how the schema is currently being handled and then implement a solution. Let me now look at how the schema handling is currently implemented: Based on my analysis of the code, I understand the problem. The database schema is very large, and the current implementation in `SchemaAgent` tries to cache all schema information at initialization time by running multiple SQL queries for every table. This approach can be problematic with extremely large database schemas. Let me propose a solution to address this issue.

I'll create a solution that:

1. Uses a lazy loading approach for schema information
2. Implements a schema discovery strategy that only fetches tables when needed
3. Adds pagination and filtering capabilities to handle large schemas
4. Optimizes SQL queries to reduce database load

Let's implement this solution: 

goutham-m77: Think of the solution and give me approaches as to what all we can do.

GitHub Copilot: # Approaches to Handle Large Database Schemas

When working with very large database schemas in your SQL Agent project, there are several effective approaches you can implement:

## 1. Lazy Loading
Instead of loading the entire schema at initialization:
- Load schema information on-demand when specific tables are needed
- Cache only the parts of the schema that have been used
- Implement TTL (time-to-live) for cached schema elements

## 2. Progressive Schema Discovery
- Start with minimal schema information (just table names)
- Retrieve detailed column information only when a specific table is referenced
- Build relationship knowledge incrementally as queries are processed

## 3. Schema Filtering
- Allow users to specify schemas/tables relevant to their use case
- Implement regex-based filtering to include/exclude schema objects
- Create a configuration option for schema scope limitation

## 4. Chunked/Paginated Schema Loading
- Retrieve schema metadata in batches with pagination
- Implement background loading of additional schema information
- Set reasonable limits on how many tables to process at once

## 5. Persistent Schema Caching
- Store schema information in files or a lightweight database
- Implement versioning to detect and handle schema changes
- Allow manual or scheduled cache refreshes

## 6. Query-Based Schema Inference
- Analyze user queries to determine which tables/columns are needed
- Only fetch schema information relevant to the current context
- Build schema understanding based on query patterns

## 7. Schema Summarization
- Create and maintain a high-level view of the schema
- Store only critical information by default (tables, primary keys)
- Provide methods to access detailed metadata when required

Would you like me to focus on implementing any particular approach from this list?

goutham-m77: How much LLM cost would it occur to me for every user query generation if the entire schema has around 50000 tokens

GitHub Copilot: # LLM Cost Analysis for Large Schema Processing

For a database schema containing approximately 50,000 tokens, sending the entire schema with each query to Claude 3 Sonnet would be prohibitively expensive.

## Current Cost Estimate (Full Schema Approach)

Based on Claude 3 Sonnet pricing on Amazon Bedrock:
- **Input tokens**: ~$3.50 per million tokens
- **Output tokens**: ~$15.00 per million tokens

If sending the entire 50,000-token schema with every query:
- **Input cost per query**: ~$0.175 (50,000 tokens × $0.0000035)
- **Additional input**: User query + system instructions (~2,000-5,000 tokens)
- **Output tokens**: ~1,000-3,000 tokens per response
- **Total cost per query**: $0.20-0.30

This adds up quickly with multiple queries!

## Cost Reduction Strategies

1. **Schema Filtering**: Only sending relevant tables could reduce tokens by 90-95%
   - Estimated cost: $0.02-0.03 per query

2. **Lazy Loading**: Loading only tables mentioned in the query
   - Estimated cost: $0.01-0.02 per query for typical queries

3. **Schema Caching + Inference**: Using LLM to determine needed tables first
   - Two-step process: small query to identify tables (~$0.01), then main query (~$0.03)
   - Total estimated cost: $0.04 per query but with better quality

4. **Persistent Schema Understanding**: Train the agent on schema over time
   - Initial cost higher, but drops significantly for repeat queries
   - Long-term estimated cost: $0.01-0.02 per query

The most cost-effective approach would be implementing lazy loading with schema filtering, potentially reducing costs by 90-95% compared to the full schema approach.

Would you like me to implement one of these approaches to reduce your token usage and costs?

goutham-m77: how about any hybrid approach 

GitHub Copilot: # Hybrid Approach for Managing Large Database Schemas

A hybrid approach combines multiple strategies to optimize both performance and cost when handling your 50,000-token schema. Here's how to implement it:

## Two-Tier Schema Loading

```python
class SchemaAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...existing code...
        self.schema_catalog = {}  # Lightweight metadata (table names, types)
        self.detailed_schema = {}  # Detailed schema info (loaded on demand)
        self.recently_used = []   # Track recently used tables
        self.schema_cache_file = "schema_cache.json"
        # ...existing code...
    
    def initialize(self):
        """Initialize with just basic catalog information"""
        if os.path.exists(self.schema_cache_file):
            self._load_schema_from_cache()
        else:
            self._load_basic_catalog()
    
    def _load_basic_catalog(self):
        """Load only table names and primary keys"""
        # Query that gets only table names and primary keys
        # Much lighter than full schema details
```

## Query Intent Analysis

```python
def query(self, user_query):
    # Step 1: Lightweight LLM call to analyze intent
    intent_analysis = self._analyze_query_intent(user_query)
    
    # Step 2: Load only relevant schema parts
    relevant_tables = intent_analysis["relevant_tables"]
    self.schema_agent.load_tables_detail(relevant_tables)
    
    # Step 3: Proceed with regular query processing using focused schema
    # ...existing code...
```

## Tiered Schema Caching

```python
def load_tables_detail(self, table_names):
    """Load detailed schema info for specified tables"""
    tables_to_load = []
    
    for table in table_names:
        # Skip if we already have detailed info
        if table in self.detailed_schema:
            continue
            
        # Check if in cache file but not loaded in memory
        if self._is_in_persistent_cache(table):
            self._load_table_from_cache(table)
        else:
            tables_to_load.append(table)
    
    # Batch load tables not in cache
    if tables_to_load:
        self._fetch_detailed_schema(tables_to_load)
        self._update_cache()
```

## Progressive Relationship Discovery

```python
def discover_relationships(self, primary_tables):
    """Discover relationships only for specific tables"""
    # Only discover relationships for tables we're actually using
    # This avoids loading entire relationship graph
    relationships = {}
    
    for table in primary_tables:
        # Find tables with foreign keys to this table
        # Find tables this table references
        # Only include these relationships
    
    return relationships
```

## Implementation Benefits

This hybrid approach:

1. **Reduces token count by 90-95%** in most cases (5,000 tokens vs 50,000)
2. **Improves response time** by loading only necessary information
3. **Maintains schema understanding** through persistent caching
4. **Scales with database size** since it doesn't try to load everything at once
5. **Adapts to usage patterns** by prioritizing frequently used tables

Would you like me to develop any specific part of this hybrid approach in more detail?

goutham-m77: Explain the approaches in detail with an example

GitHub Copilot: # Detailed Hybrid Approaches for Large Schema Management

Let me break down the hybrid approaches with concrete examples for your SQL Agent project that handles a 50,000-token schema.

## 1. Two-Tier Schema Loading

This approach maintains two levels of schema information:

```python
class SchemaAgent:
    def __init__(self, connection):
        self.connection = connection
        self.metadata_catalog = {}  # Light schema info (tables, primary keys)
        self.detailed_schema = {}   # Detailed schema (columns, constraints, etc.)
        self.access_history = {}    # Track table usage frequency
        
    def initialize(self):
        """Load only lightweight schema catalog initially"""
        query = """
            SELECT table_name, table_type, owner
            FROM all_tables 
            WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS', 'SYSTEM')
            ORDER BY owner, table_name
        """
        # This query is ~100x smaller than loading all column details
        # Result: ~500 tokens vs 50,000 tokens
```

**Example**: When your agent starts up, instead of loading all 500 tables with 50,000 tokens worth of column details, it loads just table names and types (~500 tokens). When a user asks about "customer orders", only then does it load the detailed schema for the relevant tables.

## 2. Query Intent Analysis

This performs a lightweight initial analysis to determine which tables are needed:

```python
def query(self, user_query):
    # Step 1: Analyze query with minimal context
    intent_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this database query and list only the database tables that would be needed:
    "{user_query}"
    
    Based on the available tables: {list(self.schema_agent.metadata_catalog.keys())}
    
    Return a JSON with just table names.
    """
    # This uses ~1,000 tokens instead of 50,000
    intent_response = self.llm_client.generate_text(intent_prompt)
    relevant_tables = extract_tables_from_response(intent_response)
    
    # Step 2: Load only the detailed schema for those tables
    self.schema_agent.load_detailed_schema(relevant_tables)
    
    # Step 3: Generate the actual SQL with focused schema context
    # ...existing query generation code...
```

**Example**: User asks "Show me customers who placed orders over $1000 last month." The intent analysis identifies only `customers` and `orders` tables are needed, so you load detailed schema for just those 2 tables (~2,000 tokens) instead of all 500 tables (50,000 tokens).

## 3. Tiered Schema Caching

This creates a persistent cache that remembers schema details across sessions:

```python
def load_detailed_schema(self, table_names):
    """Load detailed schema for specified tables"""
    tables_to_fetch = []
    cache_path = os.path.join("cache", "schema")
    os.makedirs(cache_path, exist_ok=True)
    
    for table in table_names:
        # Update access history for LRU management
        self.access_history[table] = self.access_history.get(table, 0) + 1
        
        # Skip if already loaded
        if table in self.detailed_schema:
            continue
            
        # Try to load from file cache
        cache_file = os.path.join(cache_path, f"{table}.json")
        if os.path.exists(cache_file):
            with open(cache_file, 'r') as f:
                self.detailed_schema[table] = json.load(f)
        else:
            tables_to_fetch.append(table)
    
    # Batch fetch tables not in cache
    if tables_to_fetch:
        for table in tables_to_fetch:
            columns = self._fetch_columns(table)
            constraints = self._fetch_constraints(table)
            indexes = self._fetch_indexes(table)
            
            self.detailed_schema[table] = {
                "columns": columns,
                "constraints": constraints,
                "indexes": indexes
            }
            
            # Save to cache
            with open(os.path.join(cache_path, f"{table}.json"), 'w') as f:
                json.dump(self.detailed_schema[table], f)
```

**Example**: After running queries about orders for several days, your agent has cached detailed schema for frequently used tables. When a new user asks about order processing, the schema loads instantly from cache files instead of running expensive database metadata queries.

## 4. Progressive Relationship Discovery

This discovers foreign keys and relationships only for tables actually being used:

```python
def discover_relationships(self, primary_tables):
    """Discover relationships only for tables being used"""
    relationships = {}
    seen_tables = set(primary_tables)
    tables_to_check = list(primary_tables)
    max_depth = 2  # How far to follow relationship chains
    
    for depth in range(max_depth):
        next_level = []
        for table in tables_to_check:
            # Find foreign keys pointing to this table
            incoming = self._get_foreign_keys_to(table)
            
            # Find foreign keys this table has to other tables
            outgoing = self._get_foreign_keys_from(table)
            
            relationships[table] = {
                "incoming": incoming,
                "outgoing": outgoing
            }
            
            # Add newly discovered tables to next level
            for fk in incoming + outgoing:
                related_table = fk['table']
                if related_table not in seen_tables:
                    seen_tables.add(related_table)
                    next_level.append(related_table)
        
        tables_to_check = next_level
        
    return relationships
```

**Example**: When analyzing orders data, the agent initially loads just the `orders` table. It then discovers that `orders` has foreign keys to `customers` and `products`. Instead of loading all possible relationships in the database (which could be thousands), it only loads these directly relevant relationships, reducing token usage by ~95%.

## 5. Cost Comparison With Example Query

Let's compare costs for answering "Find top customers by order value last quarter":

**Traditional Approach:**
- Load entire schema: 50,000 tokens (~$0.175)
- User query + instructions: 2,000 tokens (~$0.007)
- Total input: 52,000 tokens (~$0.182)
- Output tokens: 2,000 tokens (~$0.03)
- **Total cost: $0.212 per query**

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Intent analysis: 1,000 tokens in + 200 tokens out (~$0.0065)
- Load relevant tables (customers, orders): 2,000 tokens (~$0.007)
- Main query with focused schema: 3,000 tokens in + 2,000 tokens out (~$0.04)
- **Total cost: $0.0535 per query (75% savings)**

The hybrid approach would save approximately $0.16 per query, which adds up quickly at scale - while maintaining the same query capabilities.

goutham-m77: give it to me in theory instead of code

GitHub Copilot: # Hybrid Approaches for Managing Large Database Schemas: Theoretical Framework

Let me explain the theoretical approaches to handling extremely large database schemas (50,000+ tokens) without diving into implementation code.

## 1. Two-Tier Schema Loading

**Theory:** Maintain two distinct levels of schema information - a lightweight catalog and detailed schema information.

- **Lightweight Catalog:** Contains minimal information (table names, types, owners)
- **Detailed Schema:** Contains comprehensive metadata (columns, constraints, indexes)

**Example in Practice:** 
When your SQL Agent initializes, it only loads the names and basic metadata of all 500 tables in your database, consuming perhaps 500 tokens. When a user asks about customer purchase patterns, only then does it load the detailed schema for the `customers`, `orders`, and `products` tables, requiring perhaps 2,000 tokens instead of the full 50,000.

## 2. Query Intent Analysis

**Theory:** Before generating SQL, analyze the user's query with a lightweight LLM call to determine which tables are likely relevant.

**Process Flow:**
1. User submits natural language query
2. Agent performs lightweight analysis with minimal context
3. Agent identifies potentially relevant tables
4. Agent loads detailed schema only for those tables
5. Agent generates final SQL with focused schema context

**Example in Practice:**
When a user asks "Show me which customers spent the most in Q1 2023," the initial analysis would identify that only `customers`, `orders`, and potentially `order_items` tables are needed - not the entire 500-table schema. This might reduce token usage from 50,000 to just 3,000.

## 3. Tiered Schema Caching

**Theory:** Create a multi-level persistence strategy for schema information to avoid repeated expensive metadata queries.

**Cache Layers:**
- **Memory Cache:** Schema information currently loaded
- **Persistent File Cache:** Schema stored between sessions
- **Access Frequency Tracking:** LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- **Versioning:** Schema hash/timestamp to detect changes

**Example in Practice:**
After running queries about sales data for several days, your agent has built a robust cache of the sales-related tables. When a new user asks about sales trends, the schema loads instantly from cache files rather than running expensive database metadata queries. If the database schema changes, a version check triggers a refresh only for the modified tables.

## 4. Progressive Relationship Discovery

**Theory:** Build knowledge of database relationships incrementally rather than all at once.

**Discovery Process:**
- Start with primary tables identified in user query
- Discover direct relationships (1-hop)
- Expand to indirect relationships only when needed (2+ hops)
- Maintain a relationship graph that grows over time

**Example in Practice:**
When analyzing order data, the agent initially loads just the `orders` table. It then discovers that `orders` has foreign keys to `customers` and `products`. Rather than loading all possible relationships in the database (which could be thousands), it builds a focused relationship graph only including these directly relevant tables and their connections.

## 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis in Real Scenarios

For a complex query about "customer purchasing patterns by demographic segment over the last fiscal year":

**Traditional Approach Cost:**
- Full schema context: 50,000 tokens
- User query + instructions: 2,000 tokens
- Total input: 52,000 tokens (~$0.18)
- Output tokens: 2,000 tokens (~$0.03)
- **Total: $0.21 per query**

**Hybrid Approach Cost:**
- Intent analysis: 1,000 tokens in + 200 tokens out (~$0.007)
- Load relevant tables (customers, orders, demographics): 3,000 tokens (~$0.01)
- Main query with focused schema: 4,000 tokens in + 2,000 tokens out (~$0.045)
- **Total: $0.062 per query (70% savings)**

The hybrid approach preserves all functionality while dramatically reducing costs and improving response times, especially important for production deployments with many users.

goutham-m77: Let me explain my use case to you

The Medicaid Unit Rebate Amount (URA) mismatch between a calculated URA (using formulas from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program) and the Medicaid Drug Program (MDP)-provided URA can arise due to several reasons. These reasons typically fall into the following categories:

🔧 1. Data Discrepancies
Incorrect AMP or BP Data: The Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and Best Price (BP) values used in your calculation may differ from what CMS received from the manufacturer.

Quarterly vs. Monthly Data Issues: Mismatches can happen if you're using preliminary or estimated AMP/BP data while CMS uses final, certified values.

Outdated NDC Mapping: Incorrect or outdated NDC (National Drug Code) product information may lead to calculation on the wrong formulation or package size.

🧮 2. Formula Misapplication or Policy Differences
Generic vs. Brand Calculation Error: Brand drugs follow a different URA formula than generics. Misclassification can yield different URAs.

Brand: Greater of 23.1% of AMP or (AMP – Best Price), adjusted for CPI.

Generic: 13% of AMP.

Missing CPI Penalty Adjustment: The additional rebate based on CPI-U (inflation penalty) may be omitted or miscalculated in your method.

📋 3. Rebate Type Misunderstanding
Baseline AMP or BP Errors: The baseline AMP/BP (from when the drug was first launched) affects CPI-based calculations. Using the wrong baseline quarter skews URA.

Line Extension Rebate Misapplied: For oral solid dosage forms, additional rebates for line extensions can apply under ACA §2501.

📆 4. Timing and Reporting Lag
CMS Updates Lag: The URA shown in MDP may include adjustments or corrections not yet reflected in your dataset.

Restated Data: Manufacturers sometimes restate AMP/BP data for previous quarters. If you're using older data, you may get an outdated URA.

🧾 5. Cap on URA
URA Cap Applied (100% AMP): As of 2024, the cap on URAs (which used to be 100% of AMP) has been removed due to the American Rescue Plan Act. If your calculation still uses a capped URA, it will mismatch.

🏢 6. CMS or MDP System-Specific Adjustments
Zero URAs for Non-Rebatable Drugs: Some NDCs may have zero URA if they are not covered or terminated, which can cause mismatches with calculated expectations.

Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement Changes: Any updates to manufacturer agreements (e.g., for new labelers) can affect URA values.

✅ How to Reconcile the Mismatch
To troubleshoot effectively:

Cross-check AMP/BP values with CMS or your source systems.

Verify NDC classification as brand/generic and dosage type.

Check CPI penalties using correct baseline AMP/BP and CPI-U values.

Review CMS URA files and quarterly rebate tapes if accessible.

Engage in manufacturer-level review if you're the labeler.

if you want I can share the database schema too


GitHub Copilot: # Hybrid Schema Management Strategy for Medicaid URA Mismatch Analysis

Based on your Medicaid Unit Rebate Amount (URA) mismatch use case, I can see this is a perfect candidate for applying the hybrid schema approach we discussed. Let me outline how this would work specifically for your domain:

## 1. Domain-Aware Schema Prioritization

Rather than loading your entire pharmaceutical database schema, prioritize the core tables related to URA calculations:

- **Primary Tables**: NDC product information, AMP data, Best Price data, CPI-U reference values
- **Secondary Tables**: Line extension mappings, rebate agreements, manufacturer information
- **Peripheral Tables**: Load only when specifically needed

This approach ensures the most relevant 20% of your schema handles 80% of your queries.

## 2. Use Case-Specific Query Templates

For your URA mismatch analysis, create pre-defined query templates that focus on each mismatch category:

- Data discrepancy detection queries
- Formula application verification queries
- Rebate type classification queries
- Timing and reporting lag analysis queries

These templates would load only the schema components needed for each specific analysis.

## 3. Progressive Relationship Discovery

Instead of mapping all relationships between tables upfront:

1. Start with core NDC product tables
2. Expand to pricing tables (AMP/BP) only when needed
3. Add CPI-adjustment tables when inflation penalties are analyzed
4. Include manufacturer agreement tables only for specific investigations

This builds a contextual relationship map that grows organically with your analysis.

## 4. Temporal Schema Awareness

Since your URA calculations involve:
- Baseline AMPs from when drugs were first launched
- Quarterly vs. monthly data
- Potential restatements of historical data

Implement schema loading that's time-period aware, fetching only the relevant temporal slice of your schema for each analysis.

## 5. Business Logic Caching

Similar to the business rules in your example code, create specialized detection rules for each URA mismatch category:

```
"ura_calculation_mismatch": {
    "name": "URA Calculation Mismatch",
    "description": "Detect discrepancies between calculated URAs and MDP-provided URAs",
    "severity": "high",
    ...
}
```

Each rule would access only the schema components it needs, rather than the entire database structure.

## Implementation Benefits for Your Use Case

This approach would:

1. **Reduce token usage by 90%+** for most URA analyses
2. **Speed up query generation** by focusing the context on relevant pharmaceutical data
3. **Improve result quality** by giving the LLM deeper context on the specific URA calculation components
4. **Support more complex analyses** by allowing longer, more detailed prompts within token constraints

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this approach for your Medicaid URA analysis use case?

GitHub Copilot: # Hybrid Schema Management for Medicaid URA Mismatch Analysis

Based on the extensive Medicaid rebate database schema you've shared, I can see why managing the large schema is challenging. Here's a comprehensive hybrid approach specifically designed for your URA mismatch analysis needs:

## 1. Domain-Specific Schema Tiering

Organize your schema into three tiers based on URA mismatch analysis frequency:

**Tier 1 (Always Load):**
- `MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE` (Contains both calculated and invoice URAs)
- `MN_MCD_CLAIM` (Basic claim information)
- `MN_MCD_PRICELIST_PUBLISHED` (URA reference data)

**Tier 2 (Load When Needed):**
- `MN_MCD_PROGRAM` and `MN_MCD_PROGRAM_LI` (For formula verification)
- `MN_MCD_VALIDATION_MSG` (For existing validation information)
- `MN_MCD_PAYMENT` and `MN_MCD_CLAIM_PMT` (For payment analysis)

**Tier 3 (Load Only When Specifically Referenced):**
- All other tables (MN_MCD_COMMENT, MN_MCD_TOLERANCES, etc.)

## 2. Mismatch Detection Query Templates

Create pre-defined analytical patterns for each mismatch category:

```python
# Add these to your business_rules dict in set_sample_business_rules
"ura_calculation_mismatch": {
    "name": "URA Calculation Mismatch",
    "description": "Detect discrepancies between calculated URAs and MDP-provided URAs",
    "severity": "high",
    "sql_query": """
        SELECT cl.PROD_NUM, cl.PROD_NAME, cl.SYS_CALC_URA, cl.INV_URA,
               ABS(cl.SYS_CALC_URA - cl.INV_URA) as URA_DIFF,
               (ABS(cl.SYS_CALC_URA - cl.INV_URA) / NULLIF(cl.INV_URA, 0)) * 100 as PERCENT_DIFF,
               c.CLAIM_NUM, c.STATE, c.ORIG_QTR
        FROM MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE cl
        JOIN MN_MCD_CLAIM c ON cl.CLAIM_ID = c.MCD_CLAIM_ID
        WHERE ABS(cl.SYS_CALC_URA - cl.INV_URA) > 0.01
        AND ROWNUM <= 10
    """,
    "message": "System calculated URA differs from invoice URA"
}
```

## 3. Progressive Schema Loading Implementation

This approach breaks down the schema loading process:

1. **Initial Query Analysis**
   - Examine user query for table mentions (e.g., "URA mismatch in Q1 2023")
   - Identify likely relevant tables based on domain keywords (URA, price, calculation)

2. **Just-In-Time Schema Loading**
   - Initially load only Tier 1 tables
   - If query mentions formulas or program rules, load Tier 2 program tables
   - Load additional tables only when specific analysis requires them

3. **Schema Relationship Progressive Discovery**
   - Start with core claim-to-claimline relationship
   - Add program and pricing relationships only when analysis requires formula validation
   - Build relationship map incrementally based on query needs

## 4. Query Pattern Recognition

Implement pattern detection to optimize common URA analysis workflows:

```python
def detect_ura_analysis_pattern(query_text):
    """Identify the type of URA analysis being requested"""
    patterns = {
        "basic_mismatch": ["difference", "mismatch", "variance", "incorrect URA"],
        "formula_validation": ["formula", "calculation", "CPI", "inflation", "best price"],
        "timing_analysis": ["restatement", "update", "changed", "corrected URA"],
        "cap_verification": ["URA cap", "100% AMP", "maximum URA"]
    }
    
    # Determine which pattern(s) match and return appropriate schema loading strategy
    matched_patterns = []
    for pattern, keywords in patterns.items():
        if any(keyword.lower() in query_text.lower() for keyword in keywords):
            matched_patterns.append(pattern)
    
    return matched_patterns
```

## 5. Implementation in Your Architecture

To implement this in your current SQLAgent framework:

1. **Initialize with Minimal Schema:**
   ```python
   # In SQLAgent initialization
   self.schema_agent.initialize_core_schema(["MN_MCD_CLAIM", "MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE"])
   ```

2. **Analyze Query Before Full Execution:**
   ```python
   def query(self, user_query):
       # Analyze the query intent with minimal context
       analysis = self._analyze_query_intent(user_query)
       needed_tables = analysis.get("tables", [])
       
       # Load additional schema components as needed
       self.schema_agent.load_tables_detail(needed_tables)
       
       # Continue with regular query processing
       # ...
   ```

This hybrid approach would dramatically reduce your token usage from 50,000 tokens to around 3,000-5,000 tokens for most URA mismatch analyses, while still providing the LLM with sufficient context to generate accurate SQL and insights.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this approach?

goutham-m77: Use the entire information above and create a md file detailing the next steps to be done and how we will be approaching them

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a Markdown file that outlines the next steps for implementing the hybrid schema approach for your Medicaid URA mismatch analysis project. 

Made changes.

I've created a comprehensive Markdown file detailing the next steps for implementing the schema optimization strategy for your SQL Agent project. The file is located at:

`c:\Users\gmadineni\Documents\github repos\sql-agent\docs\schema_optimization_plan.md`

The plan focuses specifically on handling your large Medicaid schema with tables like `MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE` and `MN_MCD_CLAIM` that are central to URA mismatch analysis. It outlines:

1. **Schema Tiering Strategy** - How to organize your database tables into three tiers based on frequency of use in URA analysis
2. **Query Intent Analysis** - A lightweight LLM approach to determine which tables are needed before running the main query
3. **Caching Implementation** - How to maintain schema information efficiently between sessions
4. **URA-Specific Patterns** - Specialized handlers for common URA mismatch queries
5. **Progressive Relationship Discovery** - Building table relationship knowledge incrementally

The document also includes a detailed implementation plan broken down into four phases, with estimated timelines, a cost-benefit analysis showing approximately 70% cost reduction, and a risk mitigation strategy.

Would you like me to make any changes to the document or would you like me to elaborate on any particular section of the plan?

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a document that provides context about the table mappings for the LLM to reference. 

Made changes.

I've created a comprehensive reference document that maps business entity names to their database tables for your Medicaid system. The file is located at:

`c:\Users\gmadineni\Documents\github repos\sql-agent\docs\medicaid_table_mappings.md`

This document:

1. Organizes tables by functional area (claims processing, payment processing, program configuration, etc.)
2. Provides brief descriptions of each table's purpose
3. Documents important table relationships
4. Clarifies when multiple business entities map to the same physical table

This reference will be extremely valuable for the SQL Agent when implementing the schema optimization plan, as it provides semantic context that can be used during:

1. **Query Intent Analysis** - Understanding what tables store what types of information
2. **Schema Tiering** - Refining our initial tier assignments based on functional areas
3. **Domain-Specific Processing** - Providing context about table relationships for URA analysis

The LLM can now use this document as context when determining which tables are relevant for a given query, significantly improving the accuracy of the table selection process and reducing token usage even further.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section of this reference document, or would you like to move forward with implementing any specific part of the schema optimization plan?
