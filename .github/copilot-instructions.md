# SQL Agent

This project is a deep agent for SQL database interaction that can intelligently query databases based on user input and identify data discrepancies.

Key components:
- Planning capabilities for complex query generation
- Sub-agents for specialized tasks
- File system access for data caching and persistence
- Memory module for context retention across sessions
- Capability to detect data discrepancies based on business logic

The codebase uses Python and potentially the deepagents library for agent architecture.
